### 4. Comparable Evidence Explanation Letter

**Required for:** O-1A, O-1B, EB-1A when using comparable evidence
**NOT for:** P-1A (no CE provision exists)

**Format:** DOCX, 1-2 pages per criterion

```
                 COMPARABLE EVIDENCE EXPLANATION

                        CRITERION [X]
                    [Criterion Name]


    Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v), the Petitioner submits
comparable evidence to establish the Beneficiary's eligibility under
Criterion [X] of the O-1A regulatory framework.


    I.  WHY THE STANDARD CRITERION DOES NOT READILY APPLY

        The standard criterion at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)([letter])
requires evidence of "[standard requirement text]."

        This criterion does not readily apply to the Beneficiary's
occupation for the following reasons:

        [Specific explanation - e.g., "The sport of mixed martial arts
        does not maintain formal membership associations comparable to
        traditional professional sports. Unlike baseball, basketball,
        or football, there is no players' union or professional
        association that requires outstanding achievements as a
        prerequisite for membership."]


    II. COMPARABLE EVIDENCE SUBMITTED

        In lieu of the standard evidence, the Petitioner submits:

        (1) [Description of comparable evidence item 1]
        (2) [Description of comparable evidence item 2]

        This evidence is contained in the following exhibits:

            Exhibit [X]: [Description]
            Exhibit [Y]: [Description]


    III. ANALYSIS OF COMPARABLE SIGNIFICANCE

        The submitted evidence is of comparable significance to the
        standard criterion because:

        [Detailed analysis showing how the evidence meets the
        regulatory intent]


    IV. SUPPORTING EXPERT ATTESTATION

        [Expert Name], a recognized expert in [field], has provided
        a letter confirming the comparable significance of this evidence.
        See Exhibit [Z].


                         * * *

        For the foregoing reasons, the Petitioner has established that
the Beneficiary meets Criterion [X] through comparable evidence as
permitted by 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v).
